Hi! My name is Zeqi Wu. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Statistics and Big data, Renmin University of China, advised by Prof.[Zheng Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/zheng-zhang/home), and a visiting Ph.D. student at the School of Management and Economics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (ShenZhen), advised by Prof.[Chunrong Ai](https://sme.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/1178). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Department of Statistics and Data Science, School of Economics, Xiamen University in 2023.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
